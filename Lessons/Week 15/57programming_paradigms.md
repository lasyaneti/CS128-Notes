# 04/25/22: Programming paradigms

- Programming Paradigm: style of programming

### Imperative programming
- Control flow is **explicit** 
- Commands show how the computation must be done

## Declarative programming
- Control flow is **implicit**
- Commands focused on getting result, not on how to obtain it

## Functional programming
- Control flow expressed as **combination of functions**
- Use conditional expressions and recursion to perform computation

## Programming paradigms in this class
- **Imperative programming**: writing series of statements to show the computer how to solve a problem
- **Procedural programming**: imperative but with a procedure, i.e. function calls
- **Object-oriented programming**: using objects to encapsulate program state (data) together with behavior (algorithms)
- **Recursive programming**: solving problems by breaking them into smaller pieces
- **Generic programming**: writing code that works with a variety of types, presented as arguments, i.e. function templates <..T..>

## Beyond C++
- Programming paradigms transcend C++ 

## Progression in this Course 
We went from purely imperative, to object-oriented, to recursive. All these concepts were once unfamiliar, but now feel more natural with practice.
