# 02/11/22: Language agnostic introduction to user-defined types

## Abstraction
- Think about a car!
    - You can think about its attributes (color, horsepower)
    - You can think about its behavior (lights on, parked)
- Some information is more important than other information, but there isn't a specific way to handle the uninformation information
- **Abstraction process**: denotes extraction of important information while ignoring unimportant information
- **Abstraction entity**: denotes model, view, other focused representation for an item

## Types
Types are helpful because they provide
- **Representation**: knows how to represent the data needed in an object => **USER-DEFINED TYPE/VARIABLES**
- **Operations**: knows operations to be applied to objects => **FUNCTIONS**
- User-defined types provide a blueprint for how objects are created, used, and destroyed 

## Encapsulation 
- **Encapsulation process**: encloses items in container
- **Encapsulation entity**: package/enclosure that holds enclosed items

## Interfaces
- Hides implementation while still providing user with details on **what** the object does instead of **how** it does it
